## What is Lea?

Lea is a Python package aiming at working with discrete probability distributions in an intuitive way. It allows you to model a broad range of random phenomenon’s, like dice throwing, coin tossing, gambling, weather, finance, etc. Lea lets you define random variables with given probability distributions on any set of Python objects; then, these random variables can be combined together using usual arithmetic, comparison, logical operators, as well as cartesian product, conditional probability and user-defined functions. Lea can then calculate the probability distributions on these derived random variables. Note that, by default, the _exact_ distribution is computed; a Monte-Carlo sampling method is also available, should the combinatorial becomes prohibitively large. Advanced functions let you define conditional probability tables, Bayes networks and Markov chains. With these features, Lea is definitely a toolkit for _probabilistic programming_.

Let's start by modelling a biased coin in the Python interactive console.
```
>>> from lea import *
>>> flip1 = Lea.fromValFreqs(('head',67),('tail',33))
>>> flip1
head : 67/100
tail : 33/100
```

Then let's get individual probabilities and make a random sample of 10 throws:
```
>>> P(flip1=='head')
67/100
>>> Pf(flip1=='head')
0.67
>>> flip1.random(10)
('head', 'head', 'tail', 'head', 'head', 'head', 'tail', 'head', 'tail', 'head')
```

Note that Lea internally uses integers to store probabilities, which enables for unlimited precision, even for the most unlikely event. The common usual float-point representation can be obtained when needed, using dedicated methods (see `Pf` in the example).  

We can then throw another coin, which has the same bias, and check the combinations: 
```
>>> flip2 = flip1.clone()
>>> flips = flip1 + '-' + flip2
>>> flips
head-head : 4489/10000
head-tail : 2211/10000
tail-head : 2211/10000
tail-tail : 1089/10000
>>> P(flip1==flip2)
2789/5000
>>> P(flip1!=flip2)
2211/5000
```

The following example shows how functions/methods can be applied on probability distributions and how conditional probabilities can be calculated.
```
>>> flip1.upper()
HEAD : 67/100
TAIL : 33/100
>>> flip1.upper()[0]
H : 67/100
T : 33/100
>>> def toInt(flip):
...     return 1 if flip=='head' else 0
...
>>> headCount1 = flip1.map(toInt)
>>> headCount1
0 : 33/100
1 : 67/100
>>> headCount2 = flip2.map(toInt)
>>> headCounts = headCount1 + headCount2
>>> headCounts 
0 : 1089/10000
1 : 4422/10000
2 : 4489/10000
>>> headCounts.given(flip1==flip2)
0 : 1089/5578
2 : 4489/5578
>>> headCounts.given(flip1!=flip2)
1 : 1
>>> flip1.given(headCounts==0)
tail : 1
>>> flip1.given(headCounts==1)
head : 1/2
tail : 1/2
>>> flip1.given(headCounts==2)
head : 1
```

In this example, you can notice that Lea does _lazy evaluation_, so that `flip1`, `flip2`, `headCount1`, `headCount2` and `headCounts` form a network of random variables that "remember" their causal dependencies. Based on such features, Lea can do complex probabilistic inferences like 
Markov chains and bayesian networks. For instance, the classical ["Rain-Sprinkler-Grass" bayesian network (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) is easily modeled in a couple of lines:
```
# -- rsg_net.py --------
from lea import *
rain = B(20,100)
sprinkler = Lea.if_(rain, B(1,100), B(40,100))
grassWet = Lea.buildCPT( ( ~sprinkler & ~rain, False               ),
                         ( ~sprinkler &  rain, B(80,100)),
                         (  sprinkler & ~rain, B(90,100)),
                         (  sprinkler &  rain, B(99,100)))
```

Then, this bayesian network can be imported and queried in an interactive session:
```
>>> from rsg_net import *
>>> P(grassWet & sprinkler & rain)
99/50000
>>> Pf(grassWet & sprinkler & rain)
0.00198
>>> P(rain.given(grassWet))
891/2491
>>> Pf(rain.given(grassWet))
0.3576876756322762
>>> Pf(grassWet.given(rain))
0.8019
>>> Pf(grassWet.given(sprinkler&~rain))
0.9
>>> Pf(grassWet.given(~sprinkler&~rain))
0.0
```

The inference engine remains hidden for the user who builds and queries probabilistic models in a high-level, declarative manner. Hence, Lea is definitely a toolkit for _probabilistic programming_. Note that the Lea package includes a small _probabilistic programming language_ (PPL) called _Leapp_. It provides concise syntax to make use of Lea as easy as possible, … especially for non-Python programmers! Note that Leapp is not a true programming language. It is just a thin "syntactic sugar" layer on top of Python / Lea. The good news is that you can use standard Python syntax and put Leapp expressions as needed (or the opposite!); your favorite Python modules can be used as usual. The probabilistic programming nature of Lea/Leapp is advocated in the small apologia  [P("Hello world!") = 0.28](https://bitbucket.org/piedenis/lea/wiki/LeappPPLHelloWorld).

If you are an absolute beginner in Lea, read the [Lea tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/piedenis/lea/wiki/LeaPyTutorial0), which uses pure Python.
