    '''
    Lea is an abstract class representing discrete probability distributions.

    Each instance of concrete Lea's subclasses (called simply a "Lea instance" in the following)
    represents a discrete probability distribution, which associates each value of a set of
    values with the probability that such value occurs.

    A Lea instance can be defined by a sequence of (value,probability), giving the probability 
    of each value. A Lea instance can be defined also by a sequence of values, the probability
    of a given value being its frequency in the sequence.

    Lea instances can be combined in arithmetic expressions resulting in new Lea instances, by
    obeying the following rules:

    - Lea instances can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided together,
    through +, -, *, /, // operators. The resulting distribution's values and probabilities
    are determined by combination of operand's values into sums of probability
    products (the operation known as 'convolution', for the addition case).
    - Other supported binary arithmetic operators are power (**), modulo (%) and
    divmod function.
    - Unary operators +, - and abs function are supported also.
    - The Python's operator precedence rules, with the parenthesis overrules, are fully
    respected.
    - Any object X, which is not a Lea instance, involved as argument of an
    expression containing a Lea instance, is coerced to a Lea instance
    having X has sole value, with probability 1 (i.e. occurrence of X is certain).
    - Lea instances can be compared together, through ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= operators.
    The resulting distribution is a boolean distribution, giving probability of True result
    and complementary probability of False result.
    - Boolean distributions can be combined together with AND, OR, XOR, through &, |, ^
    operators, respectively.

    WARNING: the Python's 'and', 'or' and 'not' operators shall NOT be used on Lea instances;
    this raises an exception. Replace:
           a and b    by    a & b
           a or b     by    a | b
           not a      by    ~ a

    WARNING: in boolean expression involving arithmetic comparisons, the parenthesis
    shall be used, e.g. (a < b) & (b < c)

    WARNING: the augmented comparison (a < b < c) expression shall NOT be used.; this raises
    an exception (reason: it has the same limitation as 'and' operator).

    Lea instances can be used to generate random values, respecting the given probabilities.
    There are two Lea methods for this purpose:
    - random:   calculates the exact probability distribution, then takes random values 
    - random_mc: takes random values from atomic probability distribution, then makes the 
                required calculations (Monte-Carlo algorithm)
    The random_mc is suited for complex distributions, when calculation of exact probability
    distribution is intractable. This could be used to provide an estimation of the probability
    distribution (see estimate_mc method).

    There are eleven concrete subclasses to Lea class, namely:
      Alea, Clea, Flea, Flea1, Flea2, Glea, Ilea, Rlea, Tlea, Slea and Blea.
    
    Each subclass represents a "definition" of discrete probability distribution, with its own data
    or with references to other Lea instances to be combined together through a given operation.
    Each subclass defines what are the (value,probability) pairs or how they can be generated (see
    _gen_vp method implemented in each Lea subclass). The Lea class acts as a facade, by providing
    different constructors (static methods) to instantiate these subclasses, so it is usually not
    needed to instantiate Lea subcasses explicitly. Here is an overview on these subclasses, with
    their relationships. We indicate the equivalent type of "p-expression" ("pex" for short) as
    defined in the paper on the Statues algorithm (see reference below).

    - Alea  (elementary pex) defines probability mass function ("pmf") defined by extension,
            i.e. explicit (value,P(value)) pairs 
    - Clea  (tuple pex) provides the joint of a given sequence of Lea instances
    - Flea  (functional pex) applies a given n-ary function to a given sequence of n Lea instances
    - Flea1 (functional pex) applies a given 1-ary function to a given Lea instance
    - Flea2 (functional pex) applies a given 2-ary function to two given Lea instances
    - Glea  (multi-functional pex) applies n-ary functions present in a given Lea instance to a
            given sequence of n Lea instances
    - Ilea  (conditional pex) filters the values of a given Lea instance according to a given Lea
            instance representing a boolean condition (conditional probabilities)
    - Rlea  (mixture pex) embeds Lea instances as values of a parent Lea instance 
    - Tlea  (table pex) defines CPT by a dictionary associating Lea instances to given values
    - Slea  (NO pex defined yet) defines CPT by a function associating Lea instances to given values
    - Blea  (mixture+conditional pex) defines CPT by associating Lea instances to conditions

    Instances of Lea subclasses other than Alea represent prob. distributions obtained by operations
    done on existing Lea instance(s). Any such instance forms a direct acyclic graph (DAG) structure,
    having other Lea instances as nodes and Alea instances as leaves. This uses "lazy evaluation":
    actual (value,probability) pairs are calculated only at the time they are required (e.g. display,
    query probability of a given value, etc); then, these are aggregated in a new Alea instance. This 
    Alea instance is then cached, as an attribute of the queried Lea instance, for speeding up next
    queries.

    Note that Flea1 and Flea2 subclasses have more efficient implementation than Flea subclass.
    Tlea, Slea and Blea may be used to define Bayesian networks. Tlea class is the closest to CPT
    concept since it stores the table in a dictionary. Slea allows to define CPT by means of a
    function, which could be more compact to store than an explicit table; it may be useful in
    particular for noisy-or and noisy-max models.  
    
    WARNING: The following methods are called without parentheses (for the sake of ease of use):
      P, Pf, mean, mean_f, var, var_f, std, std_f, mode, entropy, rel_entropy, redundancy, information,
      support, ps, pmf_tuple, pmf_dict, cdf_tuple, cdf_dict, p_sum
    These are applicable on any Lea instance; these are implemented and documented in the Alea class.

    Short design notes:
    
    Lea uses the "template method" design pattern: the Lea base abstract class calls the following methods,
    which are implemented in each Lea's subclass: _get_lea_children, _gen_vp and _gen_one_random_mc.
    Excepting the afore-mentioned estimate_mc method, Lea performs EXACT calculation of probability
    distributions.
    It implements an original algorithm, called the "Statues" algorithm, by reference to the game of the
    same name; this uses a variable binding mechanism that relies on Python's generators. To learn more,
    you may read the paper "Probabilistic inference using generators - the Statues algorithm", freely
    available on http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09997. The heart of the algorithm is implemented in
    Lea._gen_bound_vp method (aka GENATOMS in the paper) and <X>lea._gen_vp methods implemented in Lea's
    subclasses (aka GENATOMSBYTYPE in the paper); the final collection and condensation is done by
    Lea.calc method (aka MARG in the paper), which uses Lea._calc and Alea.pmf methods.

              respective domains; these Alea instances are then temporarily bound for calculating

              construct, (this last gives the same result but requires browsing the whole v1, v2, ...
              domains, evaluating the given equalities)

              construction referring multiple times to the same instances (e.g. conditional probability
              and Bayesian reasoning); this option has no real use, excepting demonstrating by absurd the

              this option offers NO speedup when evaluating expressions not requiring referential
